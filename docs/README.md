# Jig + FLOW design documents

These are reviewed design specifications, not shipped packages or stable
conformance labels. The public SDKs and several closed machine models remain
release gates; see
[`design-review/102-public-interface-release-gates.md`](design-review/102-public-interface-release-gates.md).

Start here:

1. [`design-review/100-final-seams.md`](design-review/100-final-seams.md) —
   concise adversarial rationale for reviewed decisions.
2. [`design-review/60-reviewed-architecture.md`](design-review/60-reviewed-architecture.md)
   — canonical whole-system architecture.
3. [`decision-index.md`](decision-index.md) — compact traceability map from
   reviewed decisions to their normative sections.
4. Focused specifications:
   - [`spec/json-values.md`](spec/json-values.md)
   - [`spec/package-format.md`](spec/package-format.md)
   - [`spec/schema-files.md`](spec/schema-files.md)
   - [`spec/runtime-adapters.md`](spec/runtime-adapters.md)
   - [`spec/capability-contracts.md`](spec/capability-contracts.md)
   - [`spec/project-policy.md`](spec/project-policy.md)
   - [`spec/journal-and-hooks.md`](spec/journal-and-hooks.md)
   - [`spec/agents-and-semantic-choice.md`](spec/agents-and-semantic-choice.md)

The remaining cross-cutting lifecycle rules are in the canonical architecture:

- [Run/1](design-review/60-reviewed-architecture.md#5-flow-run1) and
  [Service/1](design-review/60-reviewed-architecture.md#6-flow-service1);
- [effects and Agents](design-review/60-reviewed-architecture.md#9-effects-events-hooks-and-agents);
- [security and sandbox enforcement](design-review/60-reviewed-architecture.md#11-security-and-trust); and
- [updates and reconciliation](design-review/60-reviewed-architecture.md#13-desired-state-direct-editing-and-updates).

The other files under `design-review/` are preserved adversarial drafts,
rebuttals, ballots, and freeze records. They explain how the architecture was
tested, but they are historical and may contain decisions explicitly removed
from the canonical design. Git preserves superseded text; it should not be
copied forward as current specification.

Open interface candidates are explicitly non-normative, including
[`design-review/101-default-targets-and-open-routing-candidate.md`](design-review/101-default-targets-and-open-routing-candidate.md).
